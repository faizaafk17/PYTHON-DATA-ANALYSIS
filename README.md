Electric Vehicle Charging Patterns Analysis
Project Goal
The objective of this project is to analyze electric vehicle (EV) charging patterns and their related parameters to uncover insights into energy consumption, charging behavior, and overall efficiency. The analysis is aimed at optimizing charging operations and supporting better decision-making for both EV users and charging station operators.


Benefits to the Industry
This project provides valuable insights into:

Energy Efficiency: Understanding energy consumption trends based on different variables like temperature, charging rate, and vehicle characteristics can help optimize energy usage and reduce costs.
Operational Optimization: By analyzing the duration and frequency of charging sessions, companies can improve the allocation of charging infrastructure, reduce downtime, and enhance customer satisfaction.
Predictive Maintenance: Identifying patterns in energy consumption and charging rates can support the early detection of potential faults, allowing for preventive measures that extend the lifespan of charging stations.
Sustainability Goals: Insights into energy usage help in minimizing carbon footprints and advancing sustainable transportation solutions.
Python Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, particularly for handling and cleaning large datasets.
Matplotlib: To create visualizations for univariate and bivariate analyses, providing clear insights into charging behavior.
PySpan: To handle various data cleaning tasks, including handling missing data, removing duplicates, and detecting outliers.
